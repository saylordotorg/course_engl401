**Unit 5: Poetry** <span id="5"></span> 
*While he is now best known for his stage dramas, William Shakespeare
was also one of the most adept and gifted poets in the English
language.  Throughout much of his early life, Shakespeare wrote and
published some of the most lyrically beautiful, stylistically clever,
and psychologically insightful poems in the English language.  In this
unit, we will closely examine Shakespeare’s poems “Venus and Adonis,”
“The Rape of Lucrece,” and all 154 of his sonnets in order to reach a
greater understanding of some of his intellectual and poetic influences,
personal circumstances, and thematic and poetic concerns and visions.  *
