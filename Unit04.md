**Unit 4: Historical Plays** <span id="4"></span> 
*Though the first historical play we will read,* Richard III*, was one
of Shakespeare’s earliest plays, it features remarkable rhetorical
talent and brilliant characterization.  Shakespeare would go on to write
a number of rich historical plays (including* Henry V*), which together
explore the decline of feudal England and the rise of the modern
nation-state.  In this unit, we will continue our project of closely
reading Shakespeare’s most famous plays, attempting to link these plays
to those we have already read in terms of form, style, and theme.*
