**Unit 2: Comedies** <span id="2"></span> 
**In its Elizabethan usage, a “comedy” is a play that ends happily,
typically moving from a situation of mistaken identities and humorous
mix-ups to reconciliation and marriage.  In this unit, we will examine
and identify these and other Shakespearean comedic conventions while
conducting close readings of two of Shakespeare’s comedies,** "Twelfth
Night" **and** "A Midsummer Night’s Dream."
