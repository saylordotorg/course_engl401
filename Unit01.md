**Unit 1: Introductions to the Legend**
*Despite his celebrity, many of the details of William Shakespeare’s
personal life remain a mystery.  Nevertheless, we will learn what we can
about who Shakespeare was by first reviewing the few facts known about
him and then situating him within the broader sweep of the Renaissance
and the Elizabethan Period, attending to both socio-historical trends
and literary developments.  By the end of this unit, we will have a
better sense of the context in which Shakespeare wrote and the dramatic
traditions to which he was privy.  We will conclude with a brief
overview of critical concepts and terms pertaining to the study of
theater.*
