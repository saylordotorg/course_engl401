*In this unit, we will read two of Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies,
analyzing their various thematic, structural, and linguistic
achievements, while attempting to define for ourselves:  What is a
Shakespearean tragedy?  How is it different from a Shakespearean comedy,
or from an Aristotelian tragedy? *

**3.1.4 Hallmarks of the Shakespearean Tragedy** <span

    Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth”**
    Link:  A. C. Bradley’s [“Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet,

    Macbeth”](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16966/16966-h/16966-h.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions:  Please scroll down and read the introduction and
    first lecture of A.C. Bradley’s classic study of Shakespearean
    tragedy.  You might choose to do a little research yourself on A.C.
    Bradley and this work, as it has itself become a source of debate
    amongst literary critics.  Some take issue with Bradley’s overall
    approach to Shakespeare’s work, finding that he spends too much time
    exercising his own moral judgment of the characters; others point to
    factual errors in his work; and still others believe that he is
    expecting Shakespeare’s plays to conform to more contemporary
    conventions of literature than are appropriate or fair.  What do you
    think of these criticisms?  Do they matter to you?  Do they balance
    the way in which you approach Bradley’s writings?  Reading up on
    some of the criticism can help you situate his work within a
    critical discourse that will help you become an even more discerning
    reader and student of Shakespeare (and of literature more
    generally)!  
        
     Regardless of these criticisms, it cannot be ignored that Bradley’s
    work has remained incredibly influential since its original
    publication.  It has been reprinted dozens of times!  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 45 minutes.  
          
     About the link:  Project Gutenberg, a literary database, has made
    the entirety of A. C. Bradley’s essay available online.
