Many consider William Shakespeare the greatest dramatist—even the
greatest writer—of all time.  His impact on Western culture and language
is unmistakable, but his works have also been continuously read and
performed around the world, illustrating his global significance.  Over
the course of this semester, we will attempt to determine why his works
have become so widely revered, or why they seem, to quote Ben Jonson,
“not for an age, but for all time.” We will begin by familiarizing
ourselves with Elizabethan theatre, language, and culture—the world in
which Shakespeare lived and breathed.  We will then conduct close
readings of a number of Shakespeare’s most acclaimed plays, progressing
through his dramatic works by categorizing them in three groups:
comedies, tragedies, and histories.  Finally, we will turn to some of
his poetry, which Shakespeare (perhaps surprisingly) considered superior
to his plays.  By the end of this course, you will have developed a
strong understanding of Shakespeare’s works—their style, their
linguistic accomplishments, their hallmarks—as well as a working
knowledge of the Elizabethan Period in which he wrote.
